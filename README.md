# Logistics Dataset Analysis Using SQL

## Business Problem
A logistics company needs to optimize its operations to ensure efficient and cost-effective delivery of both tangible and intangible products to customers domestically and internationally. This involves integrating suppliers, manufacturers, import/export activities, and various logistical facilities at strategic, tactical, and operational levels.

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze logistics data using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. We will use fundamental MySQL functions, including:
- **GROUP BY** for aggregations
- **JOIN** for connecting related tables
- **WHERE** for filtering data
- **Aggregate functions** such as COUNT, MAX, and SUM to derive key insights

By leveraging SQL, we aim to improve decision-making in logistics operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Management System:** MySQL
- **Query Language:** SQL
- **Data Source:** Logistics dataset (structured in relational tables)
